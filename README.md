# Ecommerce Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing ecommerce data using Python. The analysis includes data cleaning, merging, and statistical analysis. This work was completed as part of a project for my Big Data Analysis class.

## Project Description

The project aims to provide insights into ecommerce data by performing various data analysis techniques. It involves cleaning and merging datasets, followed by a detailed analysis to extract meaningful insights.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project are sourced from the [Looker Ecommerce BigQuery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustafakeser4/looker-ecommerce-bigquery-dataset) on Kaggle. Due to size constraints, the datasets are not included in this repository. Please download the dataset directly from Kaggle.

## Setup

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Library Installation**: Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Datasets**: Obtain the datasets from Kaggle and place them in the appropriate directories.
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**: Open and execute the notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory to perform the analysis.

## Project Structure

- **`Notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, merging, and analysis.
  - **`[ISCS 30.19] Looker Ecommerce Data Merging.ipynb`**: Notebook for merging datasets.
  - **`[ISCS 30.19] Looker Ecommerce Data Cleaning.ipynb`**: Notebook for cleaning datasets.
  - **`[ISCS 30.10] Looker Ecommerce Data Analysis.ipynb`**: Notebook for analyzing the cleaned and merged data.
- **`[ISCS 30.19] Paper #2.pdf`**: PDF document containing the results and interpretations of the analysis.
